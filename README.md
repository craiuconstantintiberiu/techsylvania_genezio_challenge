# Tool Name

## Previous Workflow

TODO - Describe how the process was managed before using your tool. Specify how many hours can be saved by using this project.

## Solution Description

TODO - Provide a brief overview of the tool, explaining its purpose and functionality.

## Deployment

TODO - Deploy your full-stack solution using [genezio](https://genez.io/). You can use [these examples](https://github.com/Genez-io/genezio-examples) as a starting point.

TODO - Provide a link to your live app so we can test it out.

# Pure Html example

This is an example of a TODO application that introduces the user to the Genezio infrastructure with simple HTML and JavaScript, without any framework.

Note: `genezio deploy` deploys both backend and frontend. If you want to test this example out-of-the-box by running 1 command, head to the `server` directory and run `genezio deploy`.

If you want to deploy your application step-by-step, follow the guidelines below.

## Initialization

1. Run `npm install` in the `server/` folder to install the dependencies.

## Run the example locally

1. Run `genezio local` in the `server/` folder to start the local server.
2. Start the index.html by going to the `client/` folder and run `npm start`.

## Deploy the example in the Genezio infrastructure

1. Run `genezio deploy --backend` in the `server/` folder that contains also the `genezio.yaml` file. This will deploy your code in the Genezio infrastructure and it will also create an SDK that can be used to call the methods remotely.

## Deploy the frontend in Genezio Infrastructure

1. Run `genezio deploy --frontend` in the `server` folder to deploy the frontend in the Genezio infrastructure.
