# Tool Name

## Previous Workflow

Rather often, I have to integrate different data from different providers into the system. These different providers might have different ways of providing and defining their data, and so, data is fed into the system raw, to be processed later on.


One thing in common for most of the data provided is that it is in the CSV format, usually with hundreds of columns. After cleaning it up somewhat, I still have to write code to integrate the provider into the system.


The project currently uses the Doctrine ORM and hundreds of lines of code and XML files need to be written, also keeping into account different permissible naming schemes for PHP and SQL columns and properties.


This is a very time-consuming process, as a there is no standardized tool to convert a CSV, infer the datatypes present, convert the column names to a standardized and correct format, and generate the code for importing a CSV and defining the data model.


It is also very prone to failure, as I has to manually check every file and column name, every property name to ensure that there are no typos. Typos in the code can lead to very hard to find bugs, where some important data parts might not be persisted, because you might have written "EBITA" instead of "EBITDA".
## Solution Description

This solution, deployed on Genezio, allows for the uploading of a CSV file to the server and reduces the hassle of generating potentially buggy boilerplate code by a lot - checking 140 lines of code for possible typos is mind-numbing.


This CSV file is then parsed, datatypes are inferred, column names are converted to work as property names and SQL column names based on a number of rules.


Of course, the programmer can check the output of the tool, modify any datatypes or column names that he wants, and then generate the code for the data model and for importing the CSV into the database.


This solution actually saves a ton of time, as it reduces the time needed to integrate a new data provider into the system by a lot. It also reduces the chance of bugs, as the code is generated by the tool, and not by the programmer.


I would say that around 30-40 minutes can be reduced by not manually converting the data model and writing the code for importing the CSV for each provider. However, the time that I imagine would not be wasted searching for bugs due to typos is far, far higher. Just as an example, I would not have spent 4 hours debugging the entire service only to find out I missed a character.


Note that this is, at it stands at the moment, a quick and dirty solution I busted out in around 2 hours. But it's very useful already, and it has all the core functionalities already, even though the CSS might not be that good ðŸ˜†


(I did try using ChatGPT, but it makes hard-to-spot typos, even though it all looks well at first. This seems to happen on large files a lot, when continuing generation).


Access it at https://gray-wily-eel.app.genez.io. I have added two sample CSV rows of 130 columns, and you can just press submit. The file is also present in the repo, as samplecsv.csv
